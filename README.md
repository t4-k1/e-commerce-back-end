Make sure you have MySQL installed and running on your local machine. Set up your MySQL database configuration file in a `.env` file.

```
DB_NAME=ecommerce_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

## Usage

After all dependencies are installed and your database is set up, start the server with:

You will need to utilize a tool like Insomnia to be able to test API routes and view the data.
